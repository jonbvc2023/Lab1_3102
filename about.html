                    <p>For people looking to travel soon for business, leisure, and any other reason—you should look no further than the Consumers Choice Award winner as the Best Travel Agency in Calgary for the last 10years running. When travelling alone or with a group, there are many things you need to plan such as the itinerary for flight bookings, which location and what rating for hotel bookings, if you may need a car rental, or help booking local or regional tours in a destination, and most importantly Travel Insurance needs to make sure your investment and you are protected. Finite details like cabin classes, meals on flight or destination, luggage needs, transfers, etc.… are some of the other items that most people don’t think about when making their plans. But small details like this can have a real impact on your travel experience. Relative to seat selection or meals request or special assistance requests we are able to adjust for single traveler to adapt on a whim. However, for multiple passengers or groups travelling for pleasure or business, these minor details are truly an essential item that our agents will help address and manage to ensure that your travelers can enjoy a relaxed stress-free journey to focus on the task at hand.
                        And whether it’s a destination wedding or sporting team travelling for a tournament…. we have checklists to ensure that all guests are covered…no matter what type of traveler you are!!</p>
